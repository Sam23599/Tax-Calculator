# Tax Calculator Website

This project is part of the Fyle Web Development Internship Challenge. The goal is to design a website that allows users to calculate taxes based on their input.

## Challenge Outline

The tax calculation is based on the following formula:

- Overall income (after deductions) under 8 Lakhs is not taxed.
- If the overall income exceeds 8 Lakhs:
  - For individuals under the age of 40, the amount over 8 Lakhs is taxed at 30%.
  - For individuals aged 40 or above but below 60, the amount over 8 Lakhs is taxed at 40%.
  - For individuals aged 60 or above, the amount over 8 Lakhs is taxed at 10%.

Example:
- Age = 34, Income = 40 Lakhs, no deductions, tax = 0.3 * (40 - 8) = 0.3 * 32 = 9.6 Lakhs

## Project Details
